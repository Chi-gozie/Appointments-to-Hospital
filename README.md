## Summary of Findings

This is a data analysis of the noshowappointment.csv datset, which displays the entries of various patients to determine if certain factors are related to their ability to show up for their appointment in the scheduled day. The analysis shows that about 70000 of the patients showed up for their appointment, while only below half did not show up on their scheduled day. Majority of the patients did not recieve SMS as a reminder for their scheduled appointmentm, while just a few were sent an SMS. Patients age, neighbourhood, scheduled day and whether or not they received an SMS have no correlation with them showing up for their appointment on their scheduled day.

## Key Insights

The result of these analysis implies that patient's ability to show up on their scheduled day is not related to any factors and might be a personal reason. This analysis requires more information about the patients living condition and mindset towards health.
